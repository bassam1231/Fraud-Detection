# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## About
This is an end-to-end project that uses Machine Learning to identify fraud credit card transactions </br>
Very helpful when tracking down frauds and helps us save a customers day!

## TODO
- Implement better prediction & evaluation functions (e.g. improve the handling of the evaluation)
- Improve data preprocessing such that it should preprocess dataset and save it in the `/data/processed/processed.csv` directory
- Also Improve data preprocessing such that we don't need to preprocess data every time we run the project (can be done using the config file)
- Add the ability to train other classification models (bonus if we add neural networks to it.)
- EDA results (plots, reports) should be made and stored in the `Visualizations` folder
- Deploy the project (leave it to mahmoud)
